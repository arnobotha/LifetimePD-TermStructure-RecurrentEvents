# LifetimePD-TermStructure-RecurrentEvents
In the pursuit of modelling a loan's probability of default (PD) over its lifetime, repeat default events are often ignored when using Cox Proportional Hazard (PH) models. Excluding such events may produce biased and inaccurate PD-estimates, which can compromise financial buffers against future losses. Accordingly, we investigate a few subtypes of Cox-models that can incorporate recurrent default events. Using South African mortgage data, we explore both the Andersen-Gill (AG) and the Prentice-Williams-Peterson (PWP) spell-time models. These models are compared against a baseline that deliberately ignores recurrent events, called the time to first default (TFD) model. Models are evaluated using Harrellâ€™s c-statistic, adjusted Cox-Sell residuals, and a novel extension of time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. From these Cox-models, we demonstrate how to derive a portfolio-level term-structure of default risk, which is a series of marginal PD-estimates at each point of the average loan's lifetime. While the TFD-- and PWP-models do not differ significantly across all diagnostics, the AG-model underperformed expectations. Depending on the prevalence of recurrent defaults, one may therefore safely ignore them when estimating lifetime default risk. Accordingly, our work enhances the current practice of using Cox-modelling in producing timeous and accurate PD-estimates under IFRS 9.

## Structure
This R-codebase can be run sequentially using the file numbering itself as a structure. **Delinquency measures** are algorithmically defined in **DelinqM.R** as data-driven functions, which may be valuable to the practitioner outside of the study's current scope. These delinquency measures were formulated and empirically tested in [Botha2022](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358329458_The_loss_optimization_of_loan_recovery_decision_times_using_forecast_cashflows), as part of a loss optimisation exercise of recovery decision times, as implemented in the corresponding [R-codebase](https://github.com/arnobotha/The-loss-optimisation-of-loan-recovery-decision-times-using-forecast-cash-flows). A simulation study from [Botha2021](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350169758_Simulation-based_optimisation_of_the_timing_of_loan_recovery_across_different_portfolios) also demonstrated these delinquency measures at length, with its corresponding [R-codebase](https://github.com/arnobotha/Simulation-based-optimisation-of-the-timing-of-loan-recovery-across-different-portfolios). Similarly, the **TruEnd-procedure** from [Botha2025](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/380214432_The_TruEnd-procedure_Treating_trailing_zero-valued_balances_in_credit_data) and its corresponding [R-codebase](https://github.com/arnobotha/TruEnd-Procedure)  is implemented in the **TruEnd.R** script, which includes a small variety of functions related to running the TruEnd-procedure practically.

## Data
This R-codebase assumes that monthly loan performance data is available. Naturally, the data itself can't be made publically available given its sensitive nature, as well as various data privacy laws, particularly the _Protection of Personal Information (POPI)_ Act of 2013 in South Africa. However, the structure and type of data that is required for reproducing this study, is sufficiently described in the commentary within the scripts. This should enable the practitioner to extract and prepare data accordingly. Moreover, this codebase assumes South African macroeconomic data is available, as sourced and collated by internal staff of the bank in question.
